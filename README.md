# 🏡 House Price Prediction

A machine learning–based project that predicts house prices using property and location features. This system helps estimate real estate values accurately by applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression models.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes housing data and builds predictive models to estimate house prices. It demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and performance evaluation.

## 🚀 Features
- End-to-end machine learning workflow  
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Regression model implementation  
- Model performance evaluation using RMSE and R² metrics  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## 📊 Model Performance
The model is evaluated using:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score  

## ⚙️ How to Run

```bash
git clone <your-repository-link>
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
